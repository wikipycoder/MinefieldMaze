**Minefield Maze **is a Python-based game that demonstrates reinforcement learning. An agent is trained to safely navigate through a grid maze filled with randomly placed explosive and safe cells. The goal is to reach the target cell without hitting any explosive cells. This project uses Q-learning for training the agent and PyQt5 for the graphical user interface, making it an interactive example of AI in a game setting.

Features
Reinforcement Learning: The agent learns optimal paths using Q-learning, balancing rewards and penalties to reach the goal safely.
PyQt5 Interface: Visualizes the grid with color-coded cells, allowing users to observe the agentâ€™s movements in real time.
Dynamic Grid Layout: Each cell is randomly designated as safe or explosive, creating unique challenges for the agent every game.
Getting Started
Install Requirements: Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies.
Train the Agent: Use the "Train Agent" button to start training.
Play the Game: After training, click "Play" to watch the agent navigate the grid.
